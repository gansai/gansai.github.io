## Using hackerearth API

I wanted to use hackerearth API and check the request/responses.
Their API currently is simple.
It has two endpoints: compile code, run code.

1. Registered a client with HackerEarth API
2. Used sample code provided at https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/api/developers/code/legacy/
3. Installed pydev for eclipse
4. Got introduced to requests module for python.
5. Ran code and felt so good to see the output.
