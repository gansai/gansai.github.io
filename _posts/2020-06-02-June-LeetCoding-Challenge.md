## Inspiration   

I wanted to improve my problem solving skills, so found this challenge posted at LeetCode.

## Getting Started with Challenge

The first step is to visit LeetCode 

[LeetCode June Challenge](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/june-leetcoding-challenge)



## Coding Problems

### Problem1: Invert Binary Tree

My commentary:

1. This is a problem related to Binary Trees. Standard Data Structure, having left child node & right child node.
2. The solution has a recursive nature, where inversion is performed for each node, recursively.
3. By inversion , it means that, for a given node, the left child becomes right child & right child becomes left child.



### Problem2: Delete Node in a Linked List

My commentary:

1. This is a problem related to LinkedLists. Standard Data Structure, having next node and value for a given node.
2. Firstly, we might confuse ourselves with the assumption that, head of the linked list is given by default, this is where we need to be careful. We are just given a node and nothing else, and ofcourse the definition of linked list is provided in code section.
3. We can think, what we can do with the given node? What can we do, if we know the next node.
