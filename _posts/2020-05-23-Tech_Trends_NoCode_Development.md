## No Code Development

Nowadays, there is a new trend, which has spread like wildfire, atleast amongst entrepreneurs - who want a rapid market-reachable products. This trend, called No Code Development or in other words - Visual Programming, helps budding entrepreneurs to build products, using drag& drop editors to build web apps.

#### Idea2Market 

They want to reduce the time from getting the idea to shipping the product to the market.

### My Experience

As I wanted to experiment with these platforms, I tried Bubble. 

One thing I definitely want to say is that, the onboarding is mind blowing.

Anyone who has little bit of sense of products, can pick up amazingly fast and ship the products.

My personal experience is that, I followed the first lesson, using the drag and drop editor, which contains the palette.

Just go, give it a try.
