Hello BlogVisitor,

I am curious about latest technologies and ways to do things.
I am happy to try doing things practically.

### <u>Personography:-</u>

I thought that while we cite links which has helped us in our experiments,
I thought I could list down people who have helped us directly/indirectly to conduct
our experiments. I thought I could also list down people who have inspired us to conduct experiments.
This will be an ever growing list.(ArrayList)
I am grateful to all mentioned below:-

1. Family
2. Linus Torvalds (git -> github -> github.io)
3. Donald Knuth (latex)
